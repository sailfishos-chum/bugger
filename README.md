## Bugger for Sailfish OS

**Bugger** is a little tool to assist reporting bugs on https://forum.sailfishos.org, following a more or less standardized template.  

Reporting bugs in this way should improve Jollas ability to pick them up and track them internally.

For more information, see the [Help link](https://forum.sailfishos.org/t/10935)

Binary packages are available in the [SailfishOS Chum repo](https://build.sailfishos.org/package/show/sailfishos:chum/bugger) and on the Releases page of this repo.
